# Caleb Yang's Portfolio

Hey there! 👋

I'm Caleb, a senior CS student at UCI who's passionate about building tools that help people connect. I love working with TypeScript, React/Next.js, and Firebase to create experiences that are both beautiful and functional.

This portfolio showcases some of my projects and gives you a sense of who I am as a developer. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about opportunities or just say hello!
